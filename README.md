# dashboard
This project is a full-stack web application using HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, and EJS. Users submit a form with their details, which is sent to the server through a POST request. The backend validates the data and displays it using server-side rendering. The UI uses a modern glassmorphic design for a clean, attractive look.
